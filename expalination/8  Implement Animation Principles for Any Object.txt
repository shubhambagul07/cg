Practical 8  Implement Animation Principles for Any Object
Line 1: Define Animation Function

Define a function that will animate an object (e.g., a moving ball or rotating square).

Example: void animateObject()

Line 2: Initialize Variables

Initialize variables for the objectâ€™s position, velocity, and direction.

Example: float x = 0, y = 0, vx = 0.05, vy = 0.05;

Line 3: Update Position

At each frame, update the position of the object based on its velocity.

Example:

cpp
Copy
Edit
x += vx;
y += vy;
Line 4: Boundary Checks

Check if the object has hit the boundaries (e.g., the window edges). If it does, reverse the direction to create a bouncing effect.

Example:

cpp
Copy
Edit
if (x < 0 || x > windowWidth) vx = -vx;
if (y < 0 || y > windowHeight) vy = -vy;
Line 5: Draw Object

Draw the object at its updated position.

Example: drawCircle(x, y);

Line 6: Refresh Screen

Call a function to refresh the screen and display the updated animation.

Example: glutPostRedisplay();
